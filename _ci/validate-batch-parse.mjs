/**
 * The batch-reply parse contract — run in deploy.yml.
 *
 *   node _ci/validate-batch-parse.mjs
 *
 * generate-post-queue.js turns one API reply into posts. What the reply looks
 * like is not under our control, so this pins down which shapes must survive.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The 2026-09-16 run reported "the model wrote JSON that could not be parsed or
 * salvaged" on 11 of 31 calls — a third of the run's wall clock and spend, on
 * posts that had already been written. None of them were truncated: stop_reason
 * said so, which is why the error text distinguishes the two cases.
 *
 * They were BARE OBJECTS. BATCH_SIZE went 2 -> 1 the day before, so the prompt
 * began asking for "a JSON array of exactly 1 object", and a model handed that
 * instruction returns the object on its own a good fraction of the time. Both
 * layers then dropped it:
 *
 *   - JSON.parse() succeeded, but the `Array.isArray()` guard rejected the
 *     result and fell through.
 *   - salvageObjects() anchored its scan on the first `[`, which in a bare
 *     object is the "sections" field — so it scanned the inside of the post and
 *     returned section objects, none of which pass isUsablePost.
 *
 * A complete, paid-for post was thrown away by the code meant to rescue it.
 * The failure is invisible in aggregate: the run still ended 20/20, because the
 * loop just retried on the next topic.
